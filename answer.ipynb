    "When considering the health of an ecosystem, an important concept to quantify is the diversity of that system. There are several metrics commonly used to calculate ecosystem diversity, one of which is call Simpson's Diversity Index.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can calculate Simpson's Diversity ($D$) as follows:\n",

    "$D = 1 - [(\\frac{n_1}{N})^2 + (\\frac{n_2}{N})^2 + (\\frac{n_3}{N})^2 + ...]$\n",
